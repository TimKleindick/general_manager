# Measurement and Currency Handling

GeneralManager integrates physical units and currency support through the `Measurement` class. Measurements behave like numeric values, support conversions, and integrate with Django models via `MeasurementField`.

This section covers:

- [Units and currency operations](units_currency.md)
- [Field design for persistence](field_design.md)
- [Filtering and sorting measurements](filtering_sorting.md)

Refer to the [API reference](../../api/measurement.md) for exhaustive class and method documentation.
