Please use conventional commit messages for your commits. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:
fix:      A bug was fixed.
feat:     A new feature was added.
test:     A new test was added.
docs:     Documentation was updated.
refactor: The code was refactored without adding new features or fixing bugs.

Please write comments and documentation in English to ensure clarity for everyone. Use complete sentences with correct grammar and spelling. This greatly improves code readability and maintainability.
Please orient your code towards simplicity and clarity. Avoid complex structures unless absolutely necessary. If a piece of code is difficult to understand, consider refactoring it or adding comments to explain its purpose.

You can run tests with "python -m pytest". Ensure that all tests pass before committing changes. Add new tests when implementing new features or fixing bugs.
